Hosting a static website on AWS S3 is a low-cost and beginner-friendly option. First, create an S3 bucket with a unique name and allow public access. Then, enable Static Website Hosting in the bucket settings and set your home page (index.html) and optional error page (error.html). Next, add a bucket policy so visitors can access your files. After that, upload your website files into the bucket. Finally, use the S3 website endpoint link to open your site in a browser.
